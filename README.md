👋 Hi, I’m @JayJay9x - Đỗ Trung Hoà
👀 I’m interested in exploring new techniques and applying them to my current work, business and life management.
🌱 I’m currently learning practical application development skills, especially in the field of DATA.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that aim to build a team where members support each other in improving weaknesses, personal growth, and learning new knowledge.
📫 How to reach me: Feel free to contact me if you have or don't have a clear goal, or even if you're just interested in goal-setting.
😄 Pronouns: He/Him
⚡ Fun fact: The probability that I can help you might be just 0.1%, but in making a decision between 49.9% vs. 50.1%, it could make a world of difference.
